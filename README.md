# Hollow Shaft Actuator â€” CAD Study

This project is a CAD and design exercise to develop my mechanical modeling skills and learn the internal architecture of a hollow shaft actuator. I reverse engineered it from a cross-section of a harmonic drive I was given for an interview. 
<p></p>
The PowerPoint `Harmonic Drive Actuator Project.pptx` dives into design, assembly, material information, and further elaborates on all design features.

*This project was done in March 2024.*

## Assumptions / Requirements

- Minimize weight and footprint  
- Output shaft supports radial and axial loads  
- No active cooling or brake system  
- Controller and encoder output combined into a single PCB  
- Optimized for heavy loading, low speeds  
- Bearings preloaded with a slotted disk spring  
- Tolerance stack-up, vibration, deflection, and noise carefully considered
